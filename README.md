# Guessing Game - React & Redux 

### **Overview**

In this exercise we will build a guessing game, the user will be presented with 5 cities around
the globe and he will need to guess the temperature (in celsius), after each guess the app will
go to https://home.openweathermap.org/ to check if he guessed correctly, deviation of up to 5
degrees will be consider as a right answer.
At the bottom of the page we will show his answers, we will add them after each guess, first we
will print his guess and below the real value.
After 5 guesses we will replace the main area box with a new box that says if he won (3 right
guesses) or lost
